The party regrouped and thought of what to do next. Should they leave or should they continue exploring the Redbrand Hideout? 
A call was made to keep investigating the Hideout and see what else was there.
The party went east through one of the secret doors that was discovered and found a locked armory, a key was found earlier on a body and the door was unlocked. 
Many weapons were found and some were taken (Too long ago to remember what was taken...) The path was taken south into a crypt with three coffins of the deceased Tresendar family.
A magical trap was set for anyone who was not supposed to be there to trigger the skeletons laying about. The party took quick care of them.
The party went east into the jail cell where they found 3 civilians, a mother, daughter and son. 
The daughter recognized the unicorn necklace worn by Samael and recognised it as her dads, that is where Samael gave the bad news that their father had passed away. The party released the prisoners and took them with them further south east.
