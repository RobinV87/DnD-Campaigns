# 🏰 Feywild PTSD Gift for Samual

## The Ever-Chirping Trinket

---

### Item Description:
> A tiny, colorful bird made of stitched fairy wings and flower petals, tied together with glowing thread.
> 
> It chirps happily, fluttering uselessly in place.
>
> **It never stops chirping.**
>
> **You cannot destroy it.** Burning, smashing, drowning — it reforms nearby within hours.
>
> **If kept near:** the user suffers nightmares of being hunted by laughing fey, reliving the terror of the Feywild every night.

### RP Impact:
- Samual hears fairy laughter again.
- Paranoia increases.
- He may lash out if others touch or mention the trinket.
