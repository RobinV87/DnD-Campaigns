# **The History of Triboar Trail**

---

## 📜 **Origins of the Triboar Trail**
The **Triboar Trail**, sometimes called the **High Road Spur**, is an ancient trade route that stretches between the **Sword Coast and the town of Triboar**. 
Originally built to connect the **mining settlements of Phandalin** with the wider world, it played a vital role in the **transportation of ore, gems, and magical artifacts** from Wave Echo Cave.

The trail was established in the **early days of human expansion** into the region. 
Merchants, prospectors, and nobles seeking wealth carved the road through **forests, rolling plains, and rocky outcroppings**, forming a lifeline between the **burgeoning city of Neverwinter** and the inland settlements.

## ⚔️ **War, Destruction, and Abandonment** *(500 DR - 1300 DR)*
The prosperity of the trail ended **abruptly** when **Phandalin fell to the orc hordes of Uruth Ukrypt** in the **Battle of Wave Echo Cave**. 
With Phandalin in ruins and the **Forge of Spells lost**, trade along the Triboar Trail collapsed. Without the steady flow of wealth, the Lords of Neverwinter abandoned regular patrols, and the trail **fell into disrepair**.

Over the centuries, the road became a **haven for bandits, goblins, and orc warbands**. Trade between the coast and inland towns declined, forcing travelers to take longer, safer routes through **Waterdeep and Yartar** instead.

- **Goblins and bugbears** from the **Cragmaw Tribe** made the trail their hunting ground.
- **Orc warbands** from the **Sword Mountains** raided caravans and outposts.
- The trail **became overgrown**, and much of its infrastructure crumbled.
- Few **daring adventurers** attempted to reclaim it, but none succeeded.

For centuries, the trail **remained forgotten**, with only foolhardy merchants and desperate travelers daring to make the journey.

## 🌅 **The Rediscovery and Revival** *(Late 1400s DR - Present)*
Recently, with the **resettlement of Phandalin**, the Triboar Trail has begun to see renewed use.

- **Prospectors and settlers** now travel the trail in hopes of restoring Phandalin to its former glory.
- **Merchants and traders** have begun cautiously returning, though **many hire armed escorts**.
- **The Lords’ Alliance**, led by **Sildar Hallwinter**, hopes to restore order and patrol the road again.

Despite this revival, the trail remains **extremely dangerous**, with goblins, bandits, and even worse lurking along its path. If Phandalin thrives, the Triboar Trail may once again become a **major trade route**—but if **the region falls into chaos, the trail may be lost forever**.
