# **The History of Phandalin**

---

## 📜 **Origins of Phandalin**
Phandalin was founded centuries ago as a **small mining settlement**, thriving due to the discovery of the **Wave Echo Cave**. The rich veins of **gold, silver, and magical minerals** made the region an economic powerhouse in the northern Sword Coast. The **dwarves, gnomes, and humans** who settled here created a prosperous mining town, building homes, markets, and roads to connect Phandalin with **Triboar and Neverwinter**.

At the heart of Phandalin’s success was the **Forge of Spells**, an ancient magical forge within Wave Echo Cave, where powerful magical weapons and artifacts were created. The forge drew the attention of wizards, artisans, and adventurers eager to craft **legendary weapons**.

## ⚔️ **The Fall of Phandalin** *(Circa 500 DR)*
Disaster struck when **orcs of Uruth Ukrypt**, a savage warband, swept down from the **Sword Mountains**. Sensing weakness, they attacked Phandalin and the surrounding area. The town's defenders, including a powerful alliance of **dwarves, gnomes, and human mages**, fought back in the **Battle of Wave Echo Cave**.

The orcs, however, had allied with **dark sorcerers**, who unleashed **devastating magic** to break the defenders. The resulting battle was a catastrophe—**the mine collapsed, the Forge of Spells was lost, and Phandalin was burned to the ground**. Survivors fled into the wilderness, and the once-thriving town became nothing more than a forgotten ruin.

For centuries, Phandalin remained abandoned, its **roads overgrown, homes reduced to rubble, and Wave Echo Cave lost to history**.
