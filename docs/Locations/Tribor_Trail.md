# **Triboar Trail - The Road to Phandalin**

---

## 📍 **Overview**
The **Triboar Trail**, also known as the **High Road Spur**, is a rugged and dangerous trade route connecting the town of **Phandalin** to the major settlements of **Neverwinter** and **Triboar**. 
This old trail winds through **rolling hills, dense forests, and rocky outcroppings**, offering little in the way of protection for travelers. Once a thriving trade route, it has now become a **hotspot for banditry, goblin raids, and other dangers**.

## 📜 **History**
