🌫️ The Mists of Shattered Memory
"Where the veil is thin, the mists breathe. They do not guide. They choose."

These mists encircle the Pendragon region, especially near the Keep and the cult sites. They form an ever-present fogbank, but sometimes... they *breathe*.

🎭 Core Mist Behaviors

- Temporal Drift: Time passes differently. An hour inside = 8 hours outside, or vice versa.
- Directional Looping: The party walks north for hours… only to return to the same tree.
- Emotion Amplifier: Characters feel exaggerated moods: sorrow, rage, love, guilt. Fey feed on this.
- Reflection Bleed: Party sees shadow versions of themselves in the mist—these reflections may act autonomously.
- Soul Displacement: Entering the mist without proper focus causes the party to swap dreams or personalities (temporary RP effect).
- Gate Mechanic: The Feywild gates are scattered across the map, triggered by emotion, ritual, or memory.

🎲 d6 Mist Effects Table – “What Happens in the Mist?”

1. Misty Doorway: A vine-covered arch appears. Passing through leads to the Feywild or a trap reflection plane.
2. Memory Flash: One PC rolls a WIS save (DC 14). On fail, they relive a traumatic or romantic memory—and act on it involuntarily.
3. Feywild Pulse: Landscape flickers. For 1d4 minutes, the world becomes vibrant, alien, and hostile. Colors warp. Voices call their names.
4. Illusionary Safety: A cozy inn or castle appears. It's a glamour trap. Meals are fake. Beds drain HP.
5. Time Echo: The party sees themselves from the future—or past—walking a different path. Clues or warnings can be gleaned.
6. The Gate Opens: The party is transported to a mirror-version of the Pendragon Keep—but it’s alive, made of vines, and in the Feywild.

🧠 Mist Mechanic: Anchor or Be Lost

Unless the party:
- Carries a fey anchor (e.g., carved mirrorstone, ritual focus, or Dhuron’s blood),  
- Or succeeds a group WIS (Survival/Insight) check DC 15,  
...they are pulled into the Feywild or another echo dimension.

✨ Feywild Arrival Hooks

- A court of thorns led by a mockery of Pendragon's bloodline awaits them
- Dhuron’s past self exists as a fey-servant version of himself
- The Cult of the Shattered Mirror has mirror-twins in the Feywild—more dangerous than their Material selves
- Reality is warped: clocks melt, weapons hum, PCs glow with emotions
