Before the party arrived at the town, they met up with a Goliath fellow named Dreakfast, which agreed to go with the party.
The party went to see Barthen's Provisions and met up with Elmina Barthen who paid 10GP to the group. 
She asked about Gundrun if the party had seen him, which the party replied "No, not since Neverwinter."
The party decided to go back to the Goblin trail where they, and [[Gundrun]] and [[Sildar Halwinter]] got ambushed as well. 
With some tracking experience and just following a trail, they found the [[Cragmaw Hideout]]. 
The smell of bad food made Dreakfast go in a rage and jumped into 3 Goblins of which one was a boss. Dreakfast and Atunaakh had no problem taking care of these goblin's and urged the party to go on.
Elagh had to conduct business elsewhere (had to take care of Liam) and left the party just after.

Eva, Atunaakh and Dreakfast went in and found 3 wolves which Eva had tamed to be her beasts. 
The wolves, Romulus, Remulus and Steve now were following the party and listening to Eva for commands. 
During the aftermath of the taming, Eva got an arrow shot into her shoulder from a goblin on a bridge who alerted the whole cave. 
with Dreakfast and Atunaakh in front, the party battled their way up and to the right to find a whole cave full of Goblins who were ready to defend against any intruder there was.
