The party started outside of the cave after they had destroyed the remaining Goblins and saved Sildar Halwinter. 
Sildar asked the heroic party if they could take him back to Phandelver so he could rest and regroup for a plan to save his employer.
The party accepted as they were traveling that way any way. And together they were the fellowship of the walk back to Phandelver.

When the party came into Phandelver they were met with three scarlet cloaked men who were heckling Dhuron, upon which the party decided to fight the Redbrands. 
The air was filled with faint whispers and one of the Redbrands fell to the ground in agony and died on the spot. 
The party took quick care of the remaining two and gave Asher the bodies, this meant that Samael only has to deliver 17 bodies, as the grudge continues.
