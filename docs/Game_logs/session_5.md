The party started off at the edge of town where they encountered 4 Redbrand soldiers who were escorting a big almost naked man who was tied to one of the soldiers. 
The party decided to ask what was up and attacked the Redbrands. A short fight where the Big almost naked guy headbutted one of the soldiers to distract and help the ones that were fighting his captors. 
After it was done he told them that his name was Androc Dayne and that he'd really would like his clothes, armor and weapons back. Androc was asked to join them for some revenge, he said yes.
