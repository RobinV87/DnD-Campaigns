The party had rested to get to full strength again, making sure the door was closed solid. After their rest a rhythmic sound was heard from outside the door, a beat that was done from a drum. 
The door was opened and Asher stood there with an unknown person. Asher told the party that he was sick and tired of coming along and brought a fresh protege. 
While this was happening Samael was busy jumping from bed to bed falling on his face because of reasons.
The new person introduced himself as Finos and he had no idea what he was doing, but happy to go along.

The party decided to make a plan to get out of the basement of the manor and move towards the town again. 
Outside the party noticed a large force of Redbrands marching towards the town square. A plan was made to ambush and intercept and force the Redbrands to fight them. 
A big battle ensued and the Redbrands were exterminated. At the end of the battle Finos went into a fetal position and was rocking back and forth. Androc carried him in his arms towards the manor to regroup.

Then connection issues froze the game and here we are!
