The players started in the city of Neverwinter where they met Gundrun and Sildar Hallwinter. The players made a deal to transport the supplies towards Phandelin where Gundrun wanted to set up shop and start anew.
The players agreed upon the 10 gold, after hearing that it's a wage that could retire them comfortably.

The players were tasked to bring the supplies to Barthen's Provisions while Gundrun and Sildar would go first to "take care of business", what this business was did not get disclosed.

While on the road, nearing the town of Phandelin, the party discovered arrow riddled horses and got ambushed by 4 goblins. 3 were taken care of quickly and one tried to escape, with Atunaakh hounding him down to stabby mcstab stab him.

The party decided not to follow the discovered trail and travel further towards Phandelin.
