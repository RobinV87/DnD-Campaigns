As Dhuron drifts to sleep in the safety of town, he feels a cold wind brush against his face.

The crackle of old banners flapping in a dying storm.

Suddenly, he stands in the grand hall of a once-proud keep — now rotting, twisted with vines and cracked stone.

Portraits hang crooked along the walls:
Some faces he knows — family, old comrades — others are scratched out, gouged deep by clawed hands.

He sees himself, but younger, dressed in noble black armor, sword pointed downward in mourning.
His mouth moves silently — he’s trying to speak to Dhuron — but no sound comes.

A heavy iron door looms at the end of the hall, sealed by thick chains pulsing with black energy.

As Dhuron reaches for the door — a single skeletal hand bursts from beneath the cracked flagstones and grabs his ankle.
