Introduction:

The town of Phandelver sleeps beneath a gray morning sky.

Smoke rises gently from hearths, merchants stir in the square, and for once, the Sword Coast feels... calm.

But calm is a lie.

Dhuron Pendragon wakes in a cold sweat—his hands shaking, the echo of a child's scream fading from his ears.
A dream? A memory? A warning?

He doesn’t remember being a noble. He doesn’t remember the Keep. But now, the dreams have sharpened.
The name Pendragon rings like a war drum—louder each day.

And last night, the innkeeper brought rumors:

    "Bandits, mercs, even cultists—something’s drawn them east of the hills. To some ruin up on the cliffs... somethin' cursed."

The locals call it Wyrmwatch Ridge.
The name etched in faded maps?
Pendragon Keep.
