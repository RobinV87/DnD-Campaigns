With some tracking experience and just following a trail, they found the [[Cragmaw Hideout]].  The smell of bad food made Dreakfast go in a rage and jumped into 3 Goblins of which one was a boss.

And together they were the fellowship of the walk back to Phandelver.</p> <p>When the party came into Phandelver they were met with three scarlet cloaked men who were heckling Dhuron, upon which the party decided to fight the Redbrands.  The air was filled with faint whispers and one of the Redbrands fell to the ground in agony and died on the spot.

Many weapons were found and some were taken (Too long ago to remember what was taken...) The path was taken south into a crypt with three coffins of the deceased Tresendar family. A magical trap was set for anyone who was not supposed to be there to trigger the skeletons laying about. The party took quick care of them. The party went east into the jail cell where they found 3 civilians, a mother, daughter and son.  The daughter recognized the unicorn necklace worn by Samael and recognised it as her dads, that is where Samael gave the bad news that their father had passed away.

The new person introduced himself as Finos and he had no idea what he was doing, but happy to go along.</p> <p>The party decided to make a plan to get out of the basement of the manor and move towards the town again.  Outside the party noticed a large force of Redbrands marching towards the town square. A plan was made to ambush and intercept and force the Redbrands to fight them.  A big battle ensued and the Redbrands were exterminated. At the end of the battle Finos went into a fetal position and was rocking back and forth.
